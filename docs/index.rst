Welcome to Arcas' documentation!
=================================
Arcas is Python library which allow users to collect academic articles' metadata.

A large number of scholarly databases and collections offer some form of API access.
An API is an online tool to access data straight from the databases. Arcas is a tool
designed to help communicate/ping various of these APIs.

Arcas offers access to metadata of articles from the following journals
and pre-prints:

- IEEE
- PLOS
- Nature
- Springer
- arXiv

Note some journals might require you to register and generate an application
`key`. Currently, the following journals require you to register your application:

- IEEE
- Spinger

Guidelines for adding your key to the right place can be found under the :ref:`api_key`.

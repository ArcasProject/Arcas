Welcome to Arcas' documentation!
=================================
Arcas is Python library which allow users to collect academic articles' metadata.

Nowadays a large number of scholarly databases and collections offer some form of
API access. An API is an online tool to access data straight from the databases.
Arcas is a tool designed to help communicate/ping various of these APIs.

Today, Arcas offers access to metadata of articles from the following journals
and pre-prints:

- IEEE
- PLOS
- Nature
- Springer
- arXiv

In this documentation you will find a list tutorials that cover the basic usage
of the library.

Note some journals might require you to register and generate an application
`key`. Today the following publishers require you to register your application:

- IEEE
- Spinger

Details on using each API, including guidelines for adding your key to the
right place can be found under the Guides.

Thank you for using the package, do not forget to open issues with requests and

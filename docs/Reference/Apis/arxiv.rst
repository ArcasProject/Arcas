arXiv API
=====

arXiv API is hosted at arXiv.org, is a document submission and retrieval system
that is heavily used by the physics, mathematics and computer science
communities.

arXiv is set as the default API for Arcas. For more information on interacting with the
api visit the official site for the user's manual: https://arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual.

The :code:`Arxiv` class supports the following arguments as search fields:

- :code:`author`
- :code:`title`
- :code:`abstract`
- :code:`category`
- :code:`journal`
- :code:`records`
- :code:`start`

The most recent check of compatibility between Arcas and the arXiv API was done
on the 27th of August 2018.

IEEE Xplore
============

Query the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers content
repository and retrieve results for manipulation and presentation on local
web interfaces.

Information on the IEEE Xplore can be found on the official
site: https://developer.ieee.org/docs.

IEEE Xplore API requires a user to register their application in order to use the
API. Once the application has been registered an API key is generated a user
can use Arcas to collect articles.
 
Guidelines on using your API key with Arcas can be found under :ref:`api_key`.

The :code:`Ieee` class supports the following arguments as search fields:

- :code:`author`
- :code:`title`
- :code:`abstract`
- :code:`category`
- :code:`journal`
- :code:`year`
- :code:`records`
- :code:`start`

The most recent check of compatibility between Arcas and the nature.com OpenSearch
API was done on the 27th of August 2018.
